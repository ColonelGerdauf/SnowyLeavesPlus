# SnowyLeavesPlus

In Bedrock Edition, leaves slowly turn white when it is snowing.
SnowyLeavesPlus brings this feature to Java Edition!
When it is snowing, leaves will slowly turn white, and when it is not, they will turn back to normal.

## Installation

You can install SnowyLeavesPlus by downloading it and Fabric API from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/snowyleavesplus), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/snowyleavesplus) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/theRookieCoder/SnowyLeavesPlus/releases).
You can also use a mod manager like [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/), [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/), or my own [Ferium](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium).
Put the mod files in your `mods` folder, and load Minecraft using [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) or [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/install/).
