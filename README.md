# SnowyLeavesPlus

In Bedrock Edition, leaves turn white when it is snowing. SnowyLeavesPlus brings this feature to Java Edition! When it is snowing leaves will slowly turn whiter, and when it is not they will turn back to normal.

## Installation

You can install SnowyLeavesPlus by [downloading it](https://modrinth.com/mod/snowyleavesplus) and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
Then put the mod jars in your `mods` folder and load Minecraft using [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).
You can also use a mod manager like [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/) or my own [Ferium](https://github.com/theRookieCoder/ferium).
